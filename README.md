Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
MyApplication is an event tracking app that lets users log in, create, view, and manage events with optional SMS reminders. It was designed to help users stay organized through a simple, user-friendly layout.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The app includes login, event, and SMS reminder screens with large buttons and a clear layout for easy navigation. Its dark, Spotify-style theme keeps the design modern and accessible, creating a smooth user experience.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I used a step-by-step approach, testing each feature before moving to the next to catch errors early. I also organized the code into separate classes for cleaner structure and used GitHub Copilot to speed up development.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested the app in the Android Emulator after each major change to confirm that all screens and database actions worked correctly. This helped me fix layout bugs, database issues, and permission errors early in the process.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I faced issues with Gradle syncs, Java versions, and linking my database tables correctly. I overcame these by researching documentation, testing small fixes, and adjusting the project setup until everything compiled smoothly.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was most successful with creating a clean UI and a working login and event system connected to a local database. This showed my growth in Android development, problem solving, and app design organization.
